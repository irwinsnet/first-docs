    "# FIRST District Points\n",
    "FRC Teams earn *district points* at their first two district competitions. The district points are used to rank teams within the district and to determine which teams qualify for the district championship.

    "> Do not confuse district points with *ranking points*. Ranking points are earned in qualification matches (e.g., two points for a win, one point for a tie, etc.) and are used to rank FRC teams for alliance selection. Ranking points apply only to a single event, but teams earn district points over their entire season.\n",

    "The #1 ranked team at the end of all qualification matches receives 22 points and the bottom ranked team receives 4 points. The point calculation for all other teams uses a complicated mathematical formula with two inputs: the team's rank and the number of teams at the event.
